"""Launch the CDJ-2000 GUI simulator, display its framebuffer, and drive it.

The window is laid out like the front of the player, and that layout is the
point rather than decoration:

    Only the inner rectangle is the 480x234 panel.  BROWSE / TAG LIST / INFO /
    MENU across the top and LINK / USB / SD / DISC down the left are hardware
    buttons -- backlit plastic that appears in no frame dump.

So the virtual buttons sit **beside** the picture, never inside it, in the
positions the reference photo `cdj2000-interface-real-unit.jpg` puts them.  A
button that were drawn into the panel image would be inventing LCD content, and
this project has already spent time chasing exactly that mistake.

The picture itself is **cropped, not resampled**: the PPI emits 255 lines, 234
of them active and 21 blanking, so the frame is cut to 480x234 and then zoomed
by whole pixels.  Capturing at 234 instead wraps the capture at the wrong point
and shifts the whole image (memory cdj-display-geometry).

Clicks go out over the control channel of `emulator/qemu/cdj2000_input.c` --
see `tools/cdj_main/panel_control.py`.  Without `--control-port` the buttons
refuse rather than doing nothing, which is the difference between a window that
says it cannot and a window that looks broken.

**The window counts its own controls, out loud.**  `panel_control.input_ids()`
enumerates the 48 inputs the board decodes; `coverage()` compares that against
the controls built here and the status line says how many are reachable.  That
line exists because the same gap was found twice by accident: `plan keys` drove
38 of the 46 and printed nothing about the other eight, and this window offered
38 dedicated controls and one spinbox captioned "sweep 0..6" for the analogue
half -- the same eight, silent in the same way.  A window that is missing a
control must say so on its own face.

**Every label on a key is checked against the firmware**, not against a photo.
`panel_control.FIRMWARE_KEY_NAMES` is MAIN's own SERVICE MODE name table, and
`tests/test_panel_names_match_the_firmware.py` rebuilds it from the image and
compares it with this file, `panel_control` and both launchers.  That test
exists because the four SOURCE keys were labelled backwards here for weeks --
`SD` sent the USB bit -- and every tool involved agreed with every other one
while all of them disagreed with the board.
