# Third-party software

This repository contains no third-party source. It contains **patches against**
third-party source, and build scripts that fetch it. Each upstream keeps its own
licence; the patches inherit the licence of what they patch.

## GNU GDB 17.2 -- the Blackfin GUI board

| | |
|---|---|
| what | `sim/`, the GNU simulator, built for `bfin-elf` |
| where from | `https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-17.2.tar.xz`, fetched by `scripts/build-bfin-sim.sh` |
| licence | GPL-3.0-or-later (see `COPYING3` in the tarball) |
| our changes | `patches/01-gdb-17.2-bfin-parallel-dsp32alu.patch` and `patches/02-gdb-17.2-bfin-cdj2000-board.patch` |

The patches touch sixteen files -- twelve under `sim/bfin/` and four under
`sim/common/` -- and add no new ones. Because they are derivative of GPLv3 FSF
code, **those two patch files are GPL-3.0-or-later**, whatever the rest of this
repository is licensed under. Every file they modify keeps its FSF copyright
header intact.

Patch 01 is an ordinary correctness fix and is upstream-suitable on its own.
Patch 02 is the CDJ-specific board work and is not: it is a large body of
device modelling that only makes sense for this player.

## QEMU -- the SH-4 MAIN board

| | |
|---|---|
| what | `qemu-system-sh4`, version 11.x or newer |
| where from | `https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu.git`, cloned by you; `scripts/build-qemu-sh4.sh` builds it |
| licence | GPL-2.0-only for the emulator as a whole |
| our changes | `patches/qemu-sh-intc-priority-imask.patch` |

That patch corrects four omissions in QEMU's SH-4 interrupt path
(`hw/intc/sh_intc.c`, `target/sh4/translate.c`); `patches/README.md` explains
each one and what it costs to leave it out. Being derivative of QEMU, **it is
GPL-2.0**.

The board model in `emulator/qemu/` is our own code, not a patch. The build
script copies it into a QEMU checkout and wires it into meson and Kconfig
there, so nothing in this repository is a modified QEMU file.

QEMU 11.x or newer is required: the board includes `hw/core/boards.h` and
`system/address-spaces.h`, which are the post-reorganisation header paths.

## Nothing else is vendored

No third-party source is copied into this tree. The only binaries this
repository will ever hold are none.

## What this project's own code is licensed under

`GPL-2.0-or-later` -- `emulator/`, `tools/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, and the
documentation. See `LICENSE`. GPL-2.0-or-later was chosen because the board
model is compiled into QEMU, which is GPL-2.0-only: a GPLv3-only board could
not legally be linked into it, and a permissive licence would let the work be
taken closed.
