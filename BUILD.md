# Building

Two emulators, built separately, from sources that live outside this repository.
Neither build needs firmware.

## What you need

* **Python 3.10 or newer**, with `tkinter`. On Debian and Ubuntu that is a
  separate package, `python3-tk`.
* **A C toolchain**, `make`, `patch`, `tar`.
* For the MAIN board: **meson**, **ninja**, **pkg-config**, **glib2**,
  **pixman** -- QEMU's own dependencies.

On Windows this is developed and tested in an **MSYS2 MINGW64 shell**:

```sh
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-{glib2,pixman,meson,ninja,pkgconf,python}
```

Use the MINGW64 shell, not Git Bash. Git Bash's `make` resolves `/bin/sh` to a
path containing a space, and GDB's build system does not quote it -- the build
then fails with `C:/Program: No such file or directory`, which looks like a
broken toolchain and is not one.

Python packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt        # Pillow, numpy
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt    # ... plus pytest
```

## The GUI board -- Blackfin, from GNU sim

```sh
sh scripts/build-bfin-sim.sh
```

The script downloads `gdb-17.2.tar.xz` if it is not already beside the
repository or in `build/`, unpacks it, applies `patches/0*-gdb-*.patch`,
configures the simulator only, builds it, and installs it as `bin/cdj-run`.
Re-running it is a no-op on an already-patched tree.

Point it at a tarball or an unpacked tree if you have one:

```sh
sh scripts/build-bfin-sim.sh /path/to/gdb-17.2.tar.xz
sh scripts/build-bfin-sim.sh /path/to/gdb-17.2
```

The script builds `libbfd`, `libiberty` and `libopcodes` first, because
`bfin/run` links against them and only GDB's top-level makefile knows to build
them. It passes `MAKEINFO=true` throughout -- `makeinfo` builds the manuals and
nothing else, is often not installed, and without this the build stops on
`doc/bfd.info` with an error that says nothing about the simulator. A failure in
`po/` (translation catalogues, which want `msgfmt`) is likewise ignored, and the
three libraries are then checked for directly, so a real failure still stops the
script.

The result is around 17 MB. If you end up with something near 50 KB you have
libtool's wrapper script rather than the simulator; the script checks for
exactly this and refuses, because the wrapper exits 127 with no output and is a
confusing way to spend an afternoon.

The simulator is compiled `-O3 -march=native -g` with `--enable-sim-inline`
and `--disable-sim-assert`, because the interpreter's inner loop is the whole
cost of a run. `--march=nocona` gives a binary that runs on any x86-64,
`--opt=-O2` the upstream level, `--profile` a `-pg` build installed as
`bin/cdj-run-pg` for gprof, and `--reconfigure` throws the object tree away
first -- configure only runs when there is no `config.status`, so a change of
flags does nothing without it. `CDJ_SIM_CFLAGS` replaces the flags outright.

## The MAIN board -- SH-4, from QEMU

QEMU is not vendored here. Clone it wherever you like:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu.git /c/qemu-src
sh scripts/build-qemu-sh4.sh /c/qemu-src
```

The script applies `patches/qemu-sh-intc-priority-imask.patch`, copies
`emulator/qemu/*` into `hw/sh4/`, adds the meson and Kconfig lines if they are
not there, configures for `sh4-softmmu` only, and builds. All of it is
idempotent, so re-run it after every change to `emulator/qemu/`.

QEMU **11.x or newer** is required.

Put the result on `PATH`, or point `CDJ_QEMU` at it:

```sh
export CDJ_QEMU=/c/qemu-src/build/qemu-system-sh4
```

Check the board is there:

```sh
qemu-system-sh4 -M help | grep cdj2000
```

### Rebuild immediately, and check the timestamp

If a build of the board fails, the **old** `qemu-system-sh4` is still on disk
and every later run keeps measuring the old behaviour, while looking exactly as
though your change did nothing. This is the most expensive silent error in the
project. After each build, check the binary is newer than the source you
changed.

## Tests

```sh
pytest -q                 # or: python -m pytest -q
```

Without firmware, roughly two dozen tests skip and the rest run. The skips are
the ones that read a real firmware image; see FIRMWARE.md. `tests/cstub/`
compiles `emulator/qemu/cdj2000_input.c` on the host against stub QEMU headers,
so the panel input protocol is tested without QEMU at all.

## Where things land

| directory | holds | in git? |
|---|---|---|
| `bin/` | the Blackfin simulator you built | no |
| `build/` | the unpacked GDB tree and its object tree | no |
| `firmware/` | boot images built from your own firmware | no |
| `packets/` | stimulus the tools generate | no |
| `runs/` | frames, logs and captures from runs | no |

All five are in `.gitignore` and all five can be moved: `CDJ_BIN_DIR`,
`CDJ_BUILD_DIR`, `CDJ_FIRMWARE_DIR`, `CDJ_PACKETS_DIR`, `CDJ_RUNS_DIR`.

With one exception. The board files in `emulator/` name their flash image as
`firmware/gui-flash-image.bin`, and the simulator resolves that itself, against
the working directory the launchers set -- the repository root. So
`CDJ_FIRMWARE_DIR` moves everything the Python side reads but not that one file.
Copy the board file and pass `--board` if you need it elsewhere.
